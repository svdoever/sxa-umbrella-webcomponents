  <h1>The Stencil tester - SEO and web components</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the SEO checking project for web components created using <a href="" target="_blank">StencilJS</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    In this small web-site I want to check how search engines like Google and Bing index a website using web
    components, and how web components should be written to provide for optimal search engine optimization.
  </p>
  <h2>How?</h2>
  <p>
    Through the use of one case, an interactive addresscard web component, I will check how search engines do their
    indexing. The addresscard web component is written in two ways:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Using attributes</strong> - all data is provided to the component in attributes, except for "children" data which is in a
      slot</li>
    <li><strong>using slots</strong> - all data that is relevant for indexing is provided to the component in slots </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    I created 2 pages using the above described techniques:
  </p>

  <div><a href="index-attributes.html">AddressCard - attributes</a> - with <strong>Amy Edwards</strong> and <strong>Elen
      May</strong></div>

  <div><a href="index-slotted.html">AddressCard - slots</a> - with <strong>Amy Edwards</strong> and <strong>Vanessa
      Adams</strong></div>

  <h2>The data</h2>
  <p>
    The data is a combination of the great <a href="https://randomuser.me/" target="_blank">Random User Generator</a>
    service, and some hand-picking of random ocations on Google maps. I selected some random company addresses and
    telephone numbers to make sure the address exists, and I could select the real latitude and longitude on the map. If
    your company get's called too often I apologize!

    The query that I used to get random users was:

  <pre>https://randomuser.me/api/?nat=us&gender=female&results=4</pre>
  </p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p>
    Although StencilJS has the ability to do prerendering, it does not make sense in the case I want to test because
    pages with their components will be constructed dynamically.
